# guestbook
A sample guestbook app using codeigniter.

# Installation
You can install this project by cloning the repository and running ```composer update``` from the root directory.

# Captcha
This uses CodeIgniter's built-in captcha helper, so you need to create a sub directory off of the public/ folder:

```
cd public/
mkdir captcha
```
